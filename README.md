[Mastermind Game](https://github.com/benstamour/mastermind)
===========================================================

This project features a game of Mastermind, in which the player attempts to guess a randomly generated four-digit code. With each guess, the computer tells the player both the number of digits in their guess that are in the code in the correct position (in red) and the number of digits in their guess that are in the code but in a different position (in grey). It was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/mastermind)**. The repository also features both the build folder and the source CSS and JavaScript files.

[Feud Game](https://github.com/benstamour/feud)
===============================================

In this game, you are given one category with several answers that all fit in that category. The player's goal is to guess each of the answers before accumulating five strikes (incorrect guesses), which ends the game. Each answer has an individual point value associated with it, and the player gets the corresponding amount of points for each answer they guess correctly. This game was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/feud)** with a sample dataset. I also used animations and keyframes in CSS for the strikes and sliding reveals. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own category and answers.

[Trivia Game](https://github.com/benstamour/trivia)
===================================================

This project features a trivia game, with a grid of questions each worth a different number of points and relating to a different category. When the user clicks on one of the blue question tiles, they are given a question to answer, and if they get it correct, the value of the question is added to their score. This was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://bensta.epizy.com/trivia)**. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own questions and categories.
