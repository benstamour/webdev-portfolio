Benjamin St. Amour's Web Development Portfolio
==============================================

[Lettris](https://github.com/benstamour/lettris) (Vue.js, AJAX, PHP, SQL, JavaScript)
------------------------------------------------

This repository features code for a game where the user drops letter tiles one at a time into a grid. Once a word is formed from some of the tiles, they are removed from the grid. If the grid gets filled completely, the game ends. The game also includes features like the ability to bank a tile for later, gem tiles that provide score boosts that are given when the player spells high-scoring words, and other tiles that introduce obstacles, such as tiles that randomize their letter each turn, ones that flip the gameboard when used in a word, and more. In later levels, the probabilities of certain letters showing up also changes. The game allows input from the keyboard and also provides on-screen buttons for touchscreen users, and a toggle between light mode and dark mode is provided. The code in this repository was built using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, and the website also uses AJAX and PHP. The game is playable **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/lettris)**, where you can also create an account to join the leaderboard on the website!

[Sci-Fi Store Website](https://github.com/benstamour/starsprinter) (PHP, SQL, JavaScript)
------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes the code for a responsive website for a fictional sci-fi store, made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap. This project involved me working a lot with PHP and building and querying relational databases using MySQL, and I worked on making the site unified and appealing as well as functional, where features include a search catalogue with pagination and sortable results, a login system, the ability for users to add items to a cart and "purchase" them, and the administrative ability to add and edit items to the catalogue. You can access the website **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/starsprinter/)**.

[Bomb Defusing Game](https://github.com/benstamour/cyberbomb) (React.js)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This repository features a collaborative game in which one player sees a bomb with a timer and a series of modules, while all of the others see a manual with instructions on how to defuse the bomb. The goal is for the person with the bomb to successfully defuse it before time expires, but in order to do so, they need help from their teammates to instruct them on how to defuse it. Each bomb features a different version of each module along with a different set of instructions to follow. This project was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/cyberbomb)** or by downloading the build folder in the repository.

[Circuit Puzzle](https://github.com/benstamour/circuit-puzzle) (Vue.js)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains a program to randomly generate a puzzle involving grid of tiles, some of which can be rotated. To solve the puzzle, the tiles must be rotated in such a way that they create a path connecting the start and end points. The grid may also feature numbered portals, which will connect the path with the matching portal on the grid. The puzzle is randomly generated each time the page is loaded. This was built using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/circuit)**.

[Word Mastermind Game](https://github.com/benstamour/word-mastermind) (Vue.js)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repository features code for a game of Word Mastermind. The goal of the player is to guess the computer's secret four-letter word. Each turn, they must guess a valid word, and they will receive feedback in the form of two numbers: one being the number of letters in their guess that are in the wrong place in the secret word, and the second being the number of letters in their guess that are in the correct place in the word. The player can enter their word using either their keyboard or the buttons on-screen, and they can also change the theme/colour scheme of the page. This project was built using Vue.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/wordmastermind)**.

[Timed Word Scramble Game](https://github.com/benstamour/wordscramble) (React.js)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This repository features code for a timed word scramble game. The goal of the player is to unscramble sets of words within the time limit, with each set using one of many different categories of words. Each word unscrambled adds some additional time to the timer, and the player gets points based on the length and time taken to unscramble each word. This project was built using React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/wordscramble)**.

[Mastermind Game](https://github.com/benstamour/mastermind) (React.js)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This project features a game of Mastermind, in which the player attempts to guess a randomly generated four-digit code. With each guess, the computer tells the player both the number of digits in their guess that are in the code in the correct position (in red) and the number of digits in their guess that are in the code but in a different position (in grey). It was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/mastermind)**. The repository also features both the build folder and the source CSS and JavaScript files.

[Feud Game](https://github.com/benstamour/feud) (React.js)
-----------------------------------------------

In this game, you are given one category with several answers that all fit in that category. The player's goal is to guess each of the answers before accumulating five strikes (incorrect guesses), which ends the game. Each answer has an individual point value associated with it, and the player gets the corresponding amount of points for each answer they guess correctly. This game was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/feud)** with a sample dataset. I also used animations and keyframes in CSS for the strikes and sliding reveals. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own category and answers.

[Trivia Game](https://github.com/benstamour/trivia) (React.js)
---------------------------------------------------

This project features a trivia game, with a grid of questions each worth a different number of points and relating to a different category. When the user clicks on one of the blue question tiles, they are given a question to answer, and if they get it correct, the value of the question is added to their score. This was built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it is playable online **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/trivia)**. The repository features the source files and instructions on how to run a local version and customize the app to feature your own questions and categories.

[Vigenère Cipher](https://github.com/benstamour/vigenere) (Vue.js)
---------------------------------------------------------

This repository is my first project using Vue.js; it contains a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Vigenère cipher. You can access the webpage **[here](https://www.bensta.epizy.com/vigenere)**.
